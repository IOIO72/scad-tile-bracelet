## Description

Create your personal tile bracelet with your own message, name or symbols.

If you like to use Unicode symbols, you need to install a font like [Symbola](https://dn-works.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/UFAS-Fonts/Symbola.zip).

### Use OpenSCAD

As the Thingiverse customizer has some issues, it's better to use OpenSCAD instead.

1. **Download and install:** [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org/) version 2021.01 or newer
2. **Download:** The *.scad file of this model.
3. **Start** OpenSCAD and **open** the *.scad file in it.
4. **Open the customizer** via the menu "Window/Customizer"

Now you can configure the model and use the `F5` key to render the preview of your changes.

#### Export your STL file

If you're done with your model settings, you can export the STL file:

1. Render the mesh by pressing the `F6` key.
2. Wait until the rendering is finished. This might take some minutes.
3. Export the STL file by pressing the `F7` key.

#### Optionally save your configuration

If you like to use your configuration as a template for further models, it's a good idea, to save your configuration:

1. Click the `+` symbol in the customizer, which you find beside the configuration selector drop-down in the second line of the customizer.
2. Give your configuration a name.

Use the drop-down menu to access your saved configurations.

### Recommended print and assembly workflow

1. Export tiles and spacers as **separate parts**.
2. You may need to print the **tiles with a brim** for better hot bed adhesion.
3. Print **spacers with a raft** for better print hot bed adhesion.
4. Thread a **rubber thread** up to **half of the thread** through the upper holes of the tiles and spacers.
5. Then thread the **second half of the thread** through the lower holes of the tiles and spacers.
6. Thread both ends of the thread through the corresponding holes of the **last tile to close the bracelet**.
7. **Knot the ends** of the thread together. Keep in mind that you can still pass your hand through the bracelet.
